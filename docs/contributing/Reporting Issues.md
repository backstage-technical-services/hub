# Contributing - Reporting Issues

> Please make sure you have read the [main contribution
> guide][contributing-main] first.

## Creating a ticket

All you need to report an issue (also known as a ticket) is a [GitHub
account][github-register]; this is so that we have traceability and can
gather more information from you if needed.

All of our tickets are held in [The Hub][github-repo], which is our
centralised location for information and issue tracking. You can search
to see what people have already requested, or click the "New issue"
button to [create a new ticket][new-issue]; you will be greeted with a
list of types of ticket you can raise.

> We use templates to ensure that the correct information is captured,
> but we can't think of everything. If none of these templates are
> correct, please contact us on [Slack][slack] or let the
> [Secretary][secretary] know.

Once you have selected the type of ticket you want to raise, you'll be
greeted with a template. Please ensure you fill this in to the best of
your abilities, and provide as much information as you can. We do have a
[triage process][triage] to capture any missing information but it's
much better if we don't have to!

If you have filled in all of the required ticket detail, simply press
"Submit new issue". The template will ensure that it is labelled
correctly, and we will receive a notification in Slack.

## Marking tickets as stale

Tickets are considered stale when they haven't had any activity (eg,
comments, commits, label updates, etc) in the past 90 days. When this
point is reached a bot will add a `stale` label to the issue. If you
wish to keep this ticket open, please contact us on Slack or contact the
Secretary and we can discuss prioritisation.

> If the ticket should remain open but development on it can't happen
> for a while we can add a `keep-open` label to prevent the bot from
> automatically closing the ticket. Please don't add this label
> yourself.

## Closing stale tickets

Once a ticket is marked as `stale`, if no further activity occurs within
a further 2 weeks or the ticket isn't given the `keep-open` label then
the bot will automatically close it.

You are welcome to re-open it if you feel this ticket should not have
been closed. We also recommend you get in contact and discuss it with us
or the Secretary so we can get it prioritised to prevent it happening
again.
