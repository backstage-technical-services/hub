# Contributing - Wording Changes

> Please make sure you have read the [main contribution
> guide][contributing-main] first.

Although not recommend, it is possible to make small, simple changes
without doing anything on your local machine. This is really only for
small wording/spelling changes, and any requests to change logic with
this method will be rejected as they won't have been tested.

* **Create a fork of the repository**

  This makes a copy of the repository that's attached to your profile on
  GitHub.

* **Make the changes**

  Use GitHub's online navigator to find the page you want to change,
  click the edit icon and make the changes.

* **Save the changes**

  Use the commit dialogue at the bottom of the page to save your
  changes. If you wish to make more changes to other files then select
  the `Create a new branch` option; otherwise you can select `Commit
  directly to the main branch`.

* **Create a pull request**

  This notifies us of your changes, and allows us to combine them back
  into the main repository. Once this is done, you can safely delete
  your fork.
