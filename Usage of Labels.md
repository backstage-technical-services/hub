# Usage of Labels

It's easy to get lost in the sea of tickets in GitHub so using labels
well is vital. We use both prefixes and colours to help organise our
labels; pefixes indicate labels that relate to the same topic and
colours group labels by a broad theme.

Labels should only be applied to tickets, and not pull requests.

## Prefixes

* `needs/` is used to indicate what a ticket needs before it can be
  considered ready to work on (eg, UI design, copy, etc).
* `status/` is used to indicate where in the workflow the ticket is. A
  ticket can only have one of these labels.
* `type/` is used to indicate the type of ticket (eg, bug, feature,
  question, etc). A ticket can only have one of these labels.
* `domain/` is used to indicate which "domain" (or area of similar
  functionality) of the website is affected. A ticket can have as many
  of these as necessary.
* `platform/` is used to indicate which aspect (front or back end) of
  the site is affected. A ticket can have as many of these as necessary.
