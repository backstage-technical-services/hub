## Summary

Provide a brief explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

What is the motivation for doing this? Be as detailed as you can be; RFCs should 
invite comments from as many people as possible, so it's important to provide 
them with as much information as possible to avoid confusion.

## Drawbacks

Understanding the drawbacks is just as important as the motivation. Consider:

* Any impact on the learning curve
* Any infrastructure changes
* How this would impact the ability to address other issues
* Any additional costs
