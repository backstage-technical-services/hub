# The Hub
The Hub is the go-to place for any information about the website of Backstage Technical Services.

As we will be moving to an API and SPA, it made sense to
move issues and documentation out of the Laravel site's repository and
into a central area.

## About the society

Backstage Technical Services is a student society at the University of Bath (UK) that specialises in providing technical 
support to a variety of shows and events held both on- and off-campus. This support can range from providing a simple PA 
to musical and theatrical shows to Freshers' Week and Summer Ball.

Backstage's unique position of supporting any and every event that requires technical support results in a busy schedule 
in need of careful administration to ensure the society can function to the best of its ability.

This began as a simple paper-based system for tracking the events Backstage had been booked for but was replaced by a 
website when the manual nature of the system became difficult to manage.

Over time this website has grown from an event tracker to a feature-rich system that allows Backstage to monitor both 
the events and its membership while also providing a centralised location for paperwork and some simple tools for 
socialising.
