# Contributing

This document outlines the general guidelines for getting involved with
any and all aspects of the website.

In order to prevent this document from being daunting, it is broken up
into several separate documents that focus on a particular area of
involvement. You do not need to read all of these documents to be
involved, just the ones relevant to your level of involvement.

By contributing to this project in any way (from reporting issues to
actual development) you are agreeing to abide by the relevant
guidelines, rules and limitations outlined in these documents.

If you have any questions, or want to clarify anything, please just get
in contact with any [existing team member][team-members] or drop us a
message on [Slack][slack] (ask the Secretary if you don't have access).

> **Note:** These documents are constantly being reviewed and update;
> please make sure you review them frequently.

## Who can contribute?

Any interested Backstage member or associate is encouraged to help with
the maintenance of the site, and development of new features. Absolutely
no experience in design or programming is necessary as we all love
showing off by teaching people new skills. Of course, we also welcome
anyone with lots of experience!

There's no required level of involvement - you can be involved as little
or as much as you want.

## I can't programme - can I still contribute?

Yes, you most definitely can!

There are many ways in which you can contribute without programming,
including (but not limited to):

* Reporting bugs and suggesting features
* Making minor fixes to the wording/layout
* Defining the requirements or scope for a feature or improvement
* Testing changes pushed to the [staging server][bts-staging]
* Assisting with the administration of the various development tools
* Helping keep the team sane

## Where do I go now?

That depends on how you want to be involved!

* [I want to report issues][contributing-issues]
* [I want to make small wording changes][contributing-wording]
* [I want to get involved in development][contributing-developing]

## Questions or need help?

If you get stuck or need help, then just drop a message on [Slack][slack].
