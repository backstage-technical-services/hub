# Request for Comments

* Start Date: (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Target Decision Date: (YYYY-MM-DD)
* Target Version: (eg, 4.x)

## Summary

Provide a brief explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

What is the motivation for doing this? Be as detailed as you can be; RFCs should 
invite comments from as many people as possible, so it's important to provide 
them with as much information as possible to avoid confusion.

## Drawbacks

Understanding the drawbacks is just as important as the motivation. Consider:

* Any impact on the learning curve
* Any infrastructure changes
* How this would impact the ability to address other issues
* Any additional costs

## Alternatives

Are there any alternatives to the problem not described here? Why not choose one 
of these?

## Adoption Strategy

If the RFC is approved, how would we go about adopting or implementing it?
